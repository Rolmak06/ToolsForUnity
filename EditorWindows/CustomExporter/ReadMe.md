# Custom Exporter 

This tool allows the user to create Unity Packages using a custom interface. You can select manually and easily what to save in the package.

You can create "exporter Lists", presets of objects to export thanks to this little Scriptable Object !

If you put a folder, every object contained in it will be exported. There's also a little shy toggle for Dependencies at the bottom (it uses the same logic as the original package exporter).
