# Animation Baker Tool

Bake any physic animation into a key animation ! In Play or in Edit Mode, you can start a record to create or override an animation.

The physic simulation in Edit Mode can be quite heavy. If your scene is big or contains a lot of rigidbody, you can also record your animation in Play Mode.
