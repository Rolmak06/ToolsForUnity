# ToolsForUnity
Some tools I've created to smooth my Unity Workflow

## Editor Windows

### [Animation Baker](EditorWindows/AnimationBaker)
This Unity Tool can be used to bake physic driven animations into keyed animations. You can create / override animation either in Play Time or at Edit Time in the Unity Editor.

### [Custom Exporter](EditorWindows/CustomExporter)
This create a Custom Exporter Window for more practicle package creation inside Unity. I've struggled a lot with the embedded Package Exporter. This tool gives you the possibility to create or use export presets powered by Scriptable Objects.

### [Custom Exporter](EditorWindows/ObjectFinder)
This Editor Window is the perfect tool the find gameobjects using multiple filters. This allows complex search through your scenes and your project assets. Filters : tag, layer, name, material, shader, distance, script..
