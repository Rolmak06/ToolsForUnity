# ToolsForUnity
Some tools I've created to smooth my Unity Workflow

## Editor Windows

### [Animation Baker](EditorWindows/AnimationBaker)
This Unity Tool can be used to bake physic driven animations into keyed animations. You can create / override animation either in Play Time or at Edit Time in the Unity Editor.

### [Custom Exporter](EditorWindows/CustomExporter)
This create a Custom Exporter Window for more practicle package creation inside Unity. I've struggled a lot with the embedded Package Exporter. This tool gives you the possibility to create or use export presets powered by Scriptable Objects.

### [Object Finder](EditorWindows/ObjectFinder)
This Editor Window is the perfect tool the find gameobjects using multiple filters. This allows complex search through your scenes and your project assets. Filters : tag, layer, name, material, shader, distance, script..
Seems futile at first but when you're working on big, I mean, way big scenes, it can helps a lot !

### [Asset Bundles Tools](EditorWindows/AssetBundles)
A set of tools the create, build and manage Assets Bundles inside of Unity. You can build all your bundles or only the one you want for faster build time (that's mainly why I've created this tool). You can see which assets are in which bundles, add assets and remove assets from them.

There's currently 2 windows : Manager (inspect and manage bundles) & Builder (Build your bundles for a specific platform with specifics options at a defined location).
